🚀 Interplanetary Travel Simulation

📌 Overview

This project is a Java console application (Eclipse project) that simulates people traveling between planets using spacecrafts. The program reads passenger information from a file (Kisiler.txt) and tracks their remaining lifetime (in hours). If a person's lifetime reaches zero, they are considered deceased and excluded from the population count.

🚀 Features

Read passenger data from Kisiler.txt.

Simulate interplanetary travel between planets using spacecraft.

Track each passenger’s remaining lifetime (in hours).

Exclude deceased passengers (when lifetime = 0).

Display current population count after each simulation step.

⚙️ Requirements

Java 8 or higher

Eclipse IDE (for development & running)

🖥️ Usage

Place the Kisiler.txt file in the project directory.

Run the program from Eclipse (or terminal with java).

The program will:

Load all people from the text file.

Simulate travel between planets.

Update remaining life hours.

Exclude deceased passengers.

🔮 Future Improvements

Add support for multiple spacecrafts with capacity limits.

Implement random planet destinations.

Save simulation results to an output file.

Add statistics about survival rates and average lifetime.
